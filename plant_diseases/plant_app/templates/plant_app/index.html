      <h3>About Apple Scab :</h3>
       <h5>Apple scab is the most common disease of apple and crabapple trees in Minnesota.
        Scab is caused by a fungus that infects both leaves and fruit.
        Scabby fruit are often unfit for eating.
        Infected leaves have olive green to brown spots.
        Leaves with many leaf spots turn yellow and fall off early.
        Leaf loss weakens the tree when it occurs many years in a row.
        Planting disease resistant varieties is the best way to manage scab.
        Fungicides can be used to manage apple scab. Proper timing of sprays is needed for fungicides to control disease.

If dry weather persists after petal fall, a 10- to 14-day spray schedule is adequate for scab control.

       <h5>Black rot of crucifers is caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris. The disease is present throughout the world. It affects all members of the crucifer family and often causes severe losses. The disease affects primarily the aboveground parts of plants of any age. In hosts such as turnip and radish, however, the fleshy roots may also be affected and may develop a dry rot. Infected young seedlings show dwarfing, one-sided growth, and their lower leaves droop.

       <h5>Cedar apple rust (Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae) is a fungal disease that requires juniper plants to complete its complicated two year life-cycle. Spores overwinter as a reddish-brown gall on young twigs of various juniper species. In early spring, during wet weather, these galls swell and bright orange masses of spores are blown by the wind where they infect susceptible apple and crab-apple trees.

       <h5>Grey leaf spot (GLS) is a foliar fungal disease that affects maize, also known as corn. GLS is considered one of the most significant yield-limiting diseases of corn worldwide. There are two fungal pathogens that cause GLS: Cercospora zeae-maydis and Cercospora zeina. Symptoms seen on corn include leaf lesions, discoloration (chlorosis), and foliar blight. Distinct symptoms of GLS are rectangular, brown to gray necrotic lesions that run parallel to the leaf, spanning the spaces between the secondary leaf veins.

Pustules darken as they age. Leaves, as well as sheaths, can be infected. Under severe conditions leaf chlorosis and death may occur. Common rust can be differentiated from Southern rust by the brown pustules occurring on both top and bottom leaf surfaces with common rust.

        Northern corn leaf blight (NCLB), caused by the fungus Exserohilum turcicum, is one of the most frequently occurring foliar diseases of corn in Ohio and the Midwest in general. Since the early 2000s, both the prevalence and severity of this disease have increased, but in most years plants only becomes severely diseased well after silking. During wet weather yield losses may be as high as 30-50% if the disease becomes establishes before tasseling. However, if leaf damage is only moderate or is delayed until 6 weeks after silking, yield losses are minimal.

      <h3>About Black rot :</h3>
       <h5>
         Black rot of crucifers is caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris. The disease is present throughout the world. It affects all members of the crucifer family and often causes severe losses. The disease affects primarily the aboveground parts of plants of any age. In hosts such as turnip and radish, however, the fleshy roots may also be affected and may develop a dry rot. Infected young seedlings show dwarfing, one-sided growth, and their lower leaves droop.

        Black Measles, also called esca, black measles or Spanish measles, has long plagued grape growers with its cryptic expression of symptoms and, for a long time, a lack of identifiable causal organism(s). The name â€˜measlesâ€™ refers to the superficial spots found on the fruit

        Late blight was responsible, in large part, for the Irish Potato Famine in the 1840's, which resulted in the death and mass emigration of millions of people. Each year, Late blight reduces the yields of potatoes and tomatoes in the field and can cause major losses in potato tubers in storage.

       <h5>
        Powdery mildew is one of the most widespread and easily recognized plant diseases.
        Powdery mildews are characterized by spots or patches of white to grayish, talcum-powder-like growth.
        Powdery mildews are severe in warm, dry climates.
        Many plants have been developed to be resistant or tolerant to powdery mildew.
        Succulent tissue is more susceptible to infection. Once the disease is a problem, avoid late summer applications of nitrogen fertilizer.
        Plant resistant varieties if available.
        Chemicals are most effective when combined with cultural controls.

      <h3>About Leaf scorch :</h3>
       <h5>
        Leaf scorch is a physiological disorder that presents as discolored tissues on the margins and sometimes between the veins of tree and shrub leaves. In severe cases the whole leaf turns brown, shrivels up and drops off. Leaf scorch is, in fact, a reaction to an unfavorable environment. Though there might be multiple reasons for this condition, scorch is most often a direct result of an inadequate water supply.

Bacterial leaf scorch is caused by Xylella fastidiosa, a bacterium that is spreading across.

        Bacterial spot is the most destructive leaf disease of capsicum. Black rot of brassica plants often follows infection by bacterial spot.
        The first symptoms are usually small, yellow V-shaped areas developing along the leaf margin. These areas soon turn brown and dry out. Vein blackening may extend down the leaves into the petiole and the stem. When the stem is cut across, a black ring will be seen in the water-conducting tissues just below the bark.

      <h3>About Early Blight :</h3>
       <h5>
        Early blight is primarily a disease of stressed or senescing plants. Symptoms appear first on the oldest foliage. Affected leaves develop circular to angular dark brown lesions 0.12 to 0.16 inch (3â€“4 mm) in diameter. Concentric rings often form in lesions to produce characteristic target-board effect. Severely infected leaves turn yellow and drop. Infected tubers show a brown, corky dry rot.

       <h5>
        Late blight is one of the most serious diseases of potatoes and tomatoes worldwide, resulting in significant yield and quality losses annually. In general, in Alberta, Late blight occurs infrequently, but can have devastating impacts in the years when it reaches epidemic levels.
        Late blight was responsible, in large part, for the Irish Potato Famine in the 1840's, which resulted in the death and mass emigration of millions of people. Each year, Late blight reduces the yields of potatoes and tomatoes in the field and can cause major losses in potato tubers in storage.

In fact, leaf mold is just that: â€‹composted leaves. Instead of adding a bunch of organic matter to a pile, you only use leaves.

This fungus can attack tomatoes at any stage of development, but symptoms usually first appear on the older, lower leaves and stems when plants are setting fruit. Symptoms usually appear on leaves, but can occur on petioles, stems, and the calyx.

This virus is transmitted by an insect vector from the family Aleyrodidae and order Hemiptera, the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, commonly known as the silverleaf whitefly or the sweet potato whitefly. The primary host for TYLCV is the tomato plant, and other plant hosts where TYLCV infection has been found include eggplants, potatoes, tobacco, beans, and peppers
